			   UDP Samplicator
			   ===============

This small program receives UDP datagrams on a given port, and resends
those datagrams to a specified set of receivers.  In addition, a
sampling divisor N may be specified individually for each receiver,
which will then only receive one in N of the received packets.

The orginal author of the package could not be identified with
absolute certainty.  David Harmelin <david.harmelin@dante.org.uk> of
DANTE has added the sampling feature, and Simon Leinen
<simon@switch.ch> removed lots of unused code and packaged the program
for easier compilation/installation.

			     INSTALLATION

This distribution uses GNU configure for portability and flexibility
of installation.  You must configure the program for your system
before you can compile it using make:

	$ ./configure
	$ make

The program can then be installed (under /usr/local/bin by default)
using "make install":

	$ make install

The configure script accepts many arguments, some of which may even be
useful.  Using "./configure --prefix ..." you can specify a directory
other than /usr/local to be used as an installation destination.

				USAGE

The usage convention for the program is

	$ samplicate [<option>...] [<destination>...]

Where each <option> can be one of

	-d <level>	to set the debugging level
	-p <port>	to set the UDP port on which to listen for
			incoming packets
	-x <delay>	to specify a transmission delay in units of
			microseconds
	-h		to print a usage message and exit

and each <destination> should be specified as
<addr>[/<port>[/<interval>]], where

	<addr>		is the IP address of the receiver
	<port>		is the port UDP number of the receiver
	<freq>		is the number of received datagram between
			each copied datagram for this receiver.
