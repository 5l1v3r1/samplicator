			   UDP Samplicator		-*- text -*-
			   ===============

This small program receives UDP datagrams on a given port, and resends
those datagrams to a specified set of receivers.  In addition, a
sampling divisor N may be specified individually for each receiver,
which will then only receive one in N of the received packets.

				USAGE

The usage convention for the program is

	$ samplicate [<option>...] [<destination>...]

Where each <option> can be one of

	-d <level>	to set the debugging level
	-p <port>	to set the UDP port on which to listen for
			incoming packets
	-b <buflen>	size of receive buffer
	-x <delay>	to specify a transmission delay in units of
			microseconds
	-S		maintain (spoof) source addresses
	-h		to print a usage message and exit

and each <destination> should be specified as
<addr>[/<port>[/<interval>]], where

	<addr>		is the IP address of the receiver
	<port>		is the port UDP number of the receiver
	<freq>		is the number of received datagram between
			each copied datagram for this receiver.
