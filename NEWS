Version 1.2:

Added `-b' argument to set the size of the socket buffers.  The
default is now no longer the system default, but 65536.  If you
experience packet drops, you can try to increase the size of the
socket buffers.

Version 1.1:

Added `spoof' mode (-S).  If this is set, the samplicator will
conserve the original source address in replicated packets.  Note that
in order to use this, root privilege is necessary on most systems.
This feature has been introduced for the benefit of post-processing
software that uses the source address in NetFlow accounting packets.
For instance, Fluxoscope and newer Cflowd releases use SNMP to get
per-interface configuration data from each NetFlow-sending router.

Converted to Automake and added files to comply with GNU coding and
documentation standards.
