The orginal author of the package could not be identified with
absolute certainty.  He or she is believed to be from the Italian
research networking community.

David Harmelin <david.harmelin@dante.org.uk> of DANTE has added the
sampling feature.

Simon Leinen <simon@switch.ch> removed lots of unused code,
implemented source address spoofing (tested mainly under Solaris) and
packaged the program for easier compilation/installation.

Otmar Lendl <O.Lendl@KPNQwest.at> added source-dependent rules
and config-file parsing.
