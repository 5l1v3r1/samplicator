The orginal author of the package could not be identified with
absolute certainty.  He or she is believed to be from the Italian
research networking community.

David Harmelin <david.harmelin@dante.org.uk> of DANTE has added the
sampling feature.

Simon Leinen <simon@switch.ch> removed lots of unused code,
implemented source address spoofing (tested mainly under Solaris) and
packaged the program for easier compilation/installation.

Otmar Lendl <O.Lendl@KPNQwest.at> added source-dependent rules
and config-file parsing.

Vladimir A. Jakovenko <vovik@lucky.net> contributed a patch that makes
source address spoofing work under BSD-derived systems such as FreeBSD
and OpenBSD.  These require an additional socket option (IP_HDRINCL).

Juraj Sucik <Juraj.Sucik@cern.ch> found a bug that would cause the
`spoof' option to be randomly enabled even though the `-S' argument
wasn't passed to the program.
